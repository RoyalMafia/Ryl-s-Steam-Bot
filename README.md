# Ryl's Steam Bot
A simple bot I created.

## Required
```bash
1 Node.js
2 Cleverbot API User & Key (https://cleverbot.io/) - Not required, but the auto response won't work without it.
```

## How to install:
```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/RoyalMafia/Ryl-s-Steam-Bot.git
2 cd Ryl-s-Steam-Bot
3 npm install
4 node bot.js {Steam Username} {Steam Password}
```
When you run the script you may be asked for a Steam Guard Authentication code. 

## Current Chat Commands:
```bash
1 !cmds - Displays all available commands & a description
2 !chatroom - Creates a chat room & invites / Invites (If a chat room already exists) to exist chat room
3 !invchat - Invites you to a chat room if one exists
```
